	// any good information about the animations, other than the fact that each
	// key frame has a name assigned to it with a frame number for that animation.
	// For instance, the first animation is the "stand" animation.  The first frame
	// would have the name of: "stand01" or perhaps "stand1".  The 40th frame is
	// usually the last frame for the standing animation, so it would look like:
	// "stand40".  After this frame, the next animation is the running animation.
	// The next frame is labeled something like "run01".  You now know that the
	// standing animation is from frame 1 to frame 40 of the total frames.  The
	// start of the run animation is 41.  We will know how long the run animation
	// goes when we run into another animation name besides "run..".  That is how
	// I went about finding out the animation information.  I just grab each frame
	// name and check if it's the same animation name as the last name we found.
	// If it is, I just ignore it and continue to the next frame.  Once I find that
	// it's not, I then have the last frame saved off from the index 'i', and then
	// I create a new animation to add to the list, then start from the beginning.
	// It wasn't until later that I found on www.planetquake.com that there is a

// * QUICK NOTES * 
//
// I bet this is a lot simpler than you imagined eh?  That is the beauty of the
// Quake2 model format, it's so easy to read in.  No crazy chucks to syphon through.
// The only challenge is to think of a way to efficiently parse the animations out.
// That is, if you don't use constants for the standards set on www.planetquake.com.
// You can find that info at:
//
// http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/resources/quake2/q2frameslist.shtml
// 
// All that we really changed from the last tutorial was adding a loop to
// read in the frames, instead of just storing first frame.  The ParseAnimations()
// function was also added to step through each of the frames and store off the
// animation names, animation count, and first and last frame for each animation.
//
// You might take note that in the last tutorial we calculated the face normals of our
// model, but on second thought, I decided to not do it in our final MD2 tutorial because
// the model's texture maps are created for their own lighting and just make it darker
// than usual.  Quake2 and many other games don't use dynamic lighting because it incredibly
// slow, unless it's done on a graphics card with a GPU.
//
// If you go to Main.cpp you will see how to actually interpolate between these
// key frames.  Make sure you understand that these are NOT all the frames of
// animation, but key frames to be blended together through interpolation.  More
// on these topics will be discussed in Main.cpp.
//
// I would once again like to thank Daniel E. Schoenblum <dansch@hops.cs.jhu.edu> 
// for help with explaining the file format.
//

	// on, finding the current frame of that animation that we are on, then interpolating
	// between that frame and the next frame.  To make a smooth constant animation when
	// we get to the end frame, we interpolate between the last frame of the animation 
	// and the first frame of the animation.  That way, if we are doing the running 
	// animation let's say, when the last frame of the running animation is hit, we don't
	// have a huge jerk when going back to the first frame of that animation.  Remember,
	// because we have the texture and face information stored in the first frame of our
	// animation, we need to reference back to this frame every time when drawing the
	// model.  The only thing the other frames store is the vertices, but no information
